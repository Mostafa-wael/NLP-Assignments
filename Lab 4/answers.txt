Q2:

The dimensionality of each word embedding (vector) is 300x1


Predicted Country:
Egypt

Predicted Similarity:
0.7626821994781494

Q3:

Yes, because the relationship between Athens and Greece is similar to the relationship 
between Cairo and Egypt (both Cairo & Athens are capital cities).


Q4:

Yes, because the similarity is close to 1 (which means that the words Egypt (country2) and Cairo (city2)
are similar to one another).


Computed Accuracy:
0.9192082407594425

Q5:

Yes


Q6:

The words that appear in similar contexts are closer to each other (clustered together).
Note this model does not take into account the meaning of the words (e.g. happy & sad), 
it only looks at the context.
